  a functor implementation neither is possible, we need to map 
  (a -> Int) -> Int to (b -> Int) -> Int

  \h -> ??? ::  (b -> Int) -> Int 
  h :: (b -> Int) this is the 1st parameter to final function
  g :: (a -> Int) -> Int

  \h -> g ??? ::  (b -> Int) -> Int  we can't pass h since it's (b->Int) type and we need (a->Int)
  f :: a -> b

  h <<< f :: a -> Int

  \h -> g (h <<< f) ::  (b -> Int) -> Int

  since f is the type (a -> b) means we should be able to write a functor instance for F4
  but according to the rules we cannot that! since the polymorphic type is the input which means we shoudl
  have a contravariant
